nodejs -> not a programming language
        -> not a technology
        -> not a framework
        -> not a library

we can't write backend with only js, because it doesn't have those functionalities which the backend 
is consist of
ryan dahl wanted that we can write backend in js
google chrome's v8 engine is open source(it's made in c++)
he made a wrapper for v8
so, we write in js, which is received by the wrapper layer and that code will create a server with v8 engine with c++ modules
and this whole thing is called nodejs

It's a js runtime environment
npm- it is a package store(it's where people upload their packages which then can be installed and used by 
others)



we used npm initt -> to create package.json -> where everything about the project is written



If no package.json file, then a .js file will be considered inside a comman js module, if a package.json file is preset with type : module, then
it has ES6 moduling
if extention of the file is .mjs, then it uses ES6 moduling
